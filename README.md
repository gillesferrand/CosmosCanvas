# CosmosCanvas
A library for creating useful colour maps for different astrophysical properties, that relies on Gilles Ferrand's [colourspace](https://github.com/gillesferrand/colourspace).

Tutorials, in the form of Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3), will be added to highlight different features:
1. **Plot Spectral Index.ipynb** shows the Spectral Index colour map tools
2. **Plot Spectral Index Error.ipynb** shows how to make a spectral index error map
by Mark Richardson, Jayanne English, and Gilles Ferrand.
